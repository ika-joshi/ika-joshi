Hi, I’m Krutika. Im a third year bioinformatics student with two years of hands-on research experience in performing PCR experiments, 
managing gel electrophoresis, and using NCBI: BLAST, nucleotide, and proteins. I seek opportunity in computational 
analysis of big data and have a deep interest in analyzing various molecular interactions in human diseases. Currently, I am
looking to gain research experience in DNA analysis and protein interactions via computational methods by working under 
researchers. I have strong organization skills, teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving skills. I am proficient in Microsoft 
Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), Introductory Java, Python, R, CSS, and HTML.
